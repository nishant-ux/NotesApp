# Notes App (Java File I/O)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is my solution for **Task 4: Notes App (Java File I/O)** given in the Java Developer Internship.  
It is a **console-based text notes manager** using FileReader and FileWriter.

---

## âœ… What I Have Done
- Created a **NotesApp class** with file operations.  
- Used **FileWriter** (append mode) to add notes into a text file.  
- Used **FileReader + BufferedReader** to display notes from file.  
- Added option to **clear notes** using overwrite mode.  
- Developed a **menu-driven system** (Add Note, View Notes, Clear, Exit).  
- Implemented **exception handling** for FileNotFound and IOException.  
- Persisted user input so notes remain saved even after program exit.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Save file as **`NotesApp.java`**  
2. Open terminal and compile:
   ```bash
   javac NotesApp.java
